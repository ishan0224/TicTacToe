# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. This project demonstrates the basics of React, including state management, component structure, and event handling.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Play against a friend locally.
- **Interactive UI**: The game board updates dynamically as players take their turns.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily reset the game to start over.

## How to Play

1.  Click on any empty square on the board to make your move.

4.  If all squares are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a draw.
5.  Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
